# Cervical Cancer Prediction

Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29

Each year, about 12,000 women in the United States get cervical cancer. Cervical cancer happens most often in women 30 years or older, but all women are at risk. 

This project is an attempt to predict the occurrence of cervical cancer on the basis of several risk factors, including Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, Chlamydia infection, being overweight, long-term use of oral contraceptives (birth control pills), intrauterine device (IUD) use, having multiple full- term pregnancies, being younger than 17 at oneâ€™s first full-term pregnancy, having a family history of cervical cancer, and some hormonal drugs, e.g., Diethylstilbestrol.

This project is done as part of DATS6101 - Introduction to Data Science at The George Washington University (Nov 2018).
